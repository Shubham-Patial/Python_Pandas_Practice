# 📊 Data Analysis Practice --- Anime & Countries Datasets

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks where I explore, clean,
and analyze small datasets to practice foundational data analysis skills
using Python. The focus is on working with CSV files, performing
exploratory analysis, visualizations, and building intuition with
pandas, matplotlib, and general workflow organization.

## 📘 Notebooks Overview

### 1. **Anime Dataset Analysis**

**File:** `anime_practice.ipynb`

This notebook walks through:

-   Loading and inspecting the anime dataset\
-   Handling missing values and converting data types\
-   Sorting, filtering, and grouping data\
-   Analyzing popularity, score distribution, and genres\
-   Visualizing trends using bar charts, histograms, and line plots\
-   Extracting insights around ratings, episodes, and user engagement

### 2. **Countries Dataset Analysis**

**File:** `countries_practice.ipynb`

This notebook includes:

-   Exploring a countries dataset with demographic and economic metrics\
-   Cleaning numeric fields and handling inconsistent formatting\
-   Creating summary statistics (population, GDP, literacy etc.)\
-   Region-based comparisons\
-   Visualizations such as scatter plots, distributions, and
    comparisons\
-   Simple correlation checks between key features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   Python 3.x
-   Jupyter Notebook
-   pandas --- data manipulation\
-   matplotlib / seaborn --- visualizations\
-   numpy --- numerical utilities

## 🚀 How to Run
